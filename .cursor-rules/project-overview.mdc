This project is using Next.js 15+ with Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Bun, Drizzle, Neon, Next Auth, Vercel, Vercel Blob, Dropbox API, Stripe, Resend.

Always search for relevent files and information before working.

Keep the code simple, and readable. 

Don't do anything beyond what was explicitly asked for. 

If you have ideas to improve the website, ask permission before implementing them.

ONLY USE EXISTING API, BEFORE U ADD ANYTING NEW SEARCH IF ITS ALREADY THERE IN ANOTHER VERSIN IN THE CODE AND SIMPLY FINISH THAT.
