for giveaways.

what were gna do is were not gna have tons of giveaways at once. its just going ot be one at at ime

what we will do is have apicture of what were are doign along witha  description with a place for them to enter.
(full page )

on the backend we want to see how mnany ppl have entered.
giveaways , 

(we have brands that donate products, that we do for giveaways, vairous random items, bundles etc apparel maybe)

we give memberships... its $9.99 a month. 

when ur a member, youa re allowed to enter the contest, and you cand ot he giveaways. 

(read existing code for this)

we have not decided how frequenctly we want to do giveaways, its basic.. members automatically get one entry, and can buy more entries.



content contest is totally diff.. 

this is going to be where we work with brands directly,, brands will ask for ask for markerting material, video team. commercials.
if they dont want to pay us the money they can pay less money, and host a contest with us and give us a description of whatever they need.
the creators will compete to win that contest.  its for content creators to build up their portfolio.
the brands select a winner and use the contents creators videos and pay them etc etc. its to grow their portfolios and exposure.


content contest visual layout:

it will be left handside of page.. an image of the logo  of the contest, host. and the actual contest.
(we will have multiple content contests runing at same time so this has to be badass and oragnaized with a button to apply to each contest but have to be member to apply etc etc)

the only thing we want on the backend from that,, is when they select membership on their account.
we want the backend to show the content creators social media pages and contact info and any stats related.
if they are not content creator we dont have to have their socials.. they arent required filelds but helpful for us.

some contests will beopent oe veryone some have cap limits so we need to control that form the backend.


we need both giveaway and contests pages to be fully configurable from the backend ... read existing code and lets make that happen... no mock up code no fake shit.. allr eal fully functional productionr eady code here
